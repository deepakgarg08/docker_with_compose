#in this manager nodes and workers node are there, manager node manage workers and can also act as server. 
#multiple manager should be used in odd number like 1,3,5,7 etc recommended
#half the managers should be online to add workers or take some decisions, work like sort of voting/presence

#to make a new manager, act as leader in manager status 
docker swarm init

#after above cmd ... a cmd will be generated, which need to be run in workers, so that they can join

#to check nodes 
docker node ls

#in worker node
docker swarm leave

# to remove left workers from the list
#manager can do this'

docker node rm docker-node2 (node name)

#to make more manager 
# in manager node

docker swarm join-token manager
...will generate cmd.... 

#new manager will get status of Reachable

#hostname cmd is used to change hostname
for ex 
hostname docker-node1 or any name

#to turn off node
shutdown now

#if half the managers are down

docker node ls
give error..

in that case, other managers status will get removed by this

docker swarm init --force-new-cluster 
or
docker swarm init --force-new-cluster --advertise-addr ip (ex it will show on screen)

docker node ls
